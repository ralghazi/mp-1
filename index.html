                  My name is Sarah Johnson. I’m a third-year Computer Science student passionate about full-stack web development and
                  software engineering. I enjoy building projects that combine creativity and technical
                  problem-solving, from personal websites to data-driven applications. My goal is to grow as
                  a developer and contribute to impactful, user-focused software.

                  Outside of coursework, I regularly contribute to open-source projects and experiment with new
                  frameworks to strengthen my skills.

                  This website was created as part of my web development coursework to demonstrate my ability to design,
                  code, and deploy a complete responsive site. It serves as both a portfolio and a digital resume for
                  potential employers, mentors, and collaborators.
