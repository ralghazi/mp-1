            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>Boston University — B.A. in Computer Science</h3>
            <p><em>Expected Graduation: May 2026</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Relevant Courses: Web Development, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Database Systems, Operating Systems</li>
                <li>GPA: 3.7</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                At BU I have focused on both theoretical and applied computing, with projects ranging from implementing
                data structures in C to developing full-stack web apps with Django. This program has strengthened my
                problem-solving skills and given me hands-on experience with real-world coding practices.

                My high school years helped me develop early leadership and teamwork skills. As a member of the Robotics
                Club I gained exposure to programming hardware, which sparked my initial interest in computer science.
