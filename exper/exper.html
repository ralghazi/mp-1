            <p>
                This internship gave me valuable exposure to professional software practices, including code reviews,
                sprint planning, and cross-team collaboration. I left with a stronger understanding of full-stack
                development workflows in a real business environment.

                <li>Designed practice problems and reviewed solutions to reinforce key concepts.</li>
